Replication involves creating exact copies of data across multiple servers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. If one server fails, others can take over, ensuring data remains accessible.

Partitioning (Sharding) divides a database into smaller, more manageable pieces, distributing them across multiple servers to handle large volumes of data and high traffic more efficiently. Each shard contains a subset of the data, optimizing performance and storage.

As an example for a company using MongoDB with a growing user base and large data sets, I recommend implementing sharding to manage and scale data effectively. This approach distributes the load, preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck. Replication should be used to ensure data redundancy and availability across multiple locations.
